# Mumbai AQI Forecasting 

Air pollution is a major concern in many cities around the world, including Mumbai, India. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the air quality in a particular area, and it is used to provide information about the level of pollution in the air. The AQI is based on several air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).

In this project, we will use deep learning techniques to forecast the AQI in Mumbai. We will use historical data on air quality and weather conditions to train a deep learning model to predict the AQI for the next day.
